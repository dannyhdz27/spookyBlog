    title: "Silent Woods, Dreaming Doll",
    body: `Trapped. This realization slowly came over Amelia as she desperately tried moving her legs and arms. Stiff. Heavy. Turning her neck was impossible. She had the feeling of sinking deep underwater, the pressure crushing her from all sides, the light fading as darkness creeps in.

When had she wandered off? Just moments ago she was taking in the beams of the early morning sun. Her only hope now, she thought, was if anyone would notice she’d been missing for some time and come look for her. 

Amelia was haunted by strange dreams the night before. The forest enveloped her in an otherworldly stillness. The earth was bathed in an eerie silver glow, the trees devoid of color and standing tall and silent like sentinels. The forest drew her in, willfully guiding her way through the disorderly tumult of trees until she reached the lake.  

Amelia broke out of her rumination. She was staring up at the thick canopy overhead, suddenly aware that she was on her back, stiffened limbs sprawled out. She tried to shout but her lips wouldn’t move, and suddenly she became conscious of her breathing––or the lack thereof. No air entered her lungs. 

After some time she fell asleep. She awoke to the sensation of a tug on her arm, followed by a sharp searing pain as if hot metal was being inserted into her abdomen. She was lifted off the ground, realizing she must be caught in the sharp teeth of a giant animal. As desperately as she tried, she couldn’t make anything out in the darkness of the night.

A sickening feeling brewed in her stomach. In a moment she was thrashed about, the trees a blurred mess all around her. She was thrown up in the air and briefly felt the pull of gravity as she crashed down on the ground. 

Amelia’s body shattered on impact. The creature’s assault had torn her in two, leaving her broken and helpless. With great pain and lingering consciousness, she could sense the grotesque reality of her situation. Her only hope now was that it would all end soon. 

The next morning a small search group led by her mother and father stumbled upon a peculiar scene that defied all reason. The mangled remains of a small porcelain doll lay scattered about the forest floor covered in blood. Amelia’s parents could never fathom the horror that had befallen their daughter. Even the forest remained a silent witness to these unspeakable events, forever holding the secret of the remnants of the shattered doll. `,

    title: "Nightmare on Sanguine Street",
    body: `On a chilly Halloween night, not unlike the one many of us have experienced in our childhood, my fiance and I would find ourselves ensnared in a horrific ordeal beyond the description of words. Even now, I struggle to put pen to paper as those grim lifeless eyes that bore into my soul still linger in my mind. But I must press forth and recount the events while the lurid memory still remains unfaded. Let it be known that concealed in the shadows, the vampires dwell among us. 

It all began innocently enough, with an invitation to a Halloween party at our neighbors house on Sanguine Street, just a brief trot from our own place. Little could we have known that this seemingly harmless invitation would be more akin to a sinister snare, a trap crafted for the purpose of an obscene ritual. One meant for the extraction of our souls. 

Entering the house, we were greeted by Seraphina with an oddly cold smile and perfunctory gestures that lacked any feeling of genuine hospitality. She had a rather tall frame, with unnaturally purplish skin and glassy eyes that seemed to peer beyond you. Even for a halloween costume, the cosmetics were weirdly unsettling. As she directed us to the backyard, I couldn’t shake the feeling of being herded like sheep into the den of the night. 

Stepping into the backyard we were met with a deathly hush from the guests and strange glances that lasted only briefly before the lights suddenly went out and my composure along with them. A frightening change enveloped us. My skin felt colder, my heart beat faster and a sickening chill coursed through my spine and into my fingertips. 

Under the new moon I could vaguely make out the shadowy silhouettes of the guests as they contorted into aberrant shapes––creatures with long lanky arms and decrepit pointed fingers, with glowing amber eyes that shuffled eerily back and forth, slowly advancing toward us. The darkness of the night shrouded us in a fierce intensity that casted uncertainty over our fates.

Without any more thought I grabbed my partner's arm and bolted toward the exit, nearly knocking her off her feet. I could hear their hissing emanating from the shadows, a sound so grating it felt like nails on a chalkboard, sending shivers through my body and revealing their intention to feast on our organs and drain our bodies of blood. 

Rushing through the pitch black, I could feel their bony fingers grasping and clawing, attempting to hold us down. I tightly gripped my fiance's wrist and with a forceful tug I pushed us forward, desperation fueling every step until we stumbled through the front door. Gasping for breath but with no respite yet at hand, we fled that accursed place driven by only one objective: escape the nightmare before it swallowed us whole.

    title: "Demon Eyes",
    body: `Billy annoyingly woke in the middle of the night to the incessant barking of his German Shepherd Banter just outside his bedroom window. Another night losing sleep over his noisy companion he thought, but something about this particular clamor felt strange. A glance at the clock revealed it was nearly the witching hour. 
  
    Being a guarded man and mildly paranoid, Billy grabbed his shotgun and made his way outside to investigate. He lived far on the outskirts of civilization, far away from having to endure the suffocation of the city and its denizens, next to a wooded area that marked the border of his plot of land. It was at this edge that a shadowy figure was spotted retreating into the woods. 
    
    Before Billy could react, Banter bolted after the shadow, his barking even more frenzied. Billy tried to run after him, but it quickly became apparent that he would not stand a chance of catching up. With growing agitation exacerbated by Banter’s blatant disregard for his commands to stop, Billy made his way back inside, nary a thought about Banter’s whereabouts thereafter. Surely he couldn't have ventured too far into the woods. He’ll be back by sunrise. 
    
    But Banter never returned. 
    
    It wasn't until precisely one year after the events of that early morning when Banter went missing, that he made an appearance to Billy's surprise and delight. But Banter's resurgence would set in motion a series of events of what we now consider were demonic in nature.
    
    On the first night of Banter’s return, Billy woke up with a jolt, drenched in a cold sweat from a feverish nightmare. He sat up in his bed, his heart pounding in his chest, his breathing heavy as he tried to shake off the vestiges of the dream. His gaze fell upon Banter, who sat at the edge of the bed in the dimly lit room. His cryptic presence and cold stare made Billy feel uneasy, but not before confusion filled his mind as he tried to make sense of how Banter could have gotten inside. Banter was an outdoorsy dog who had an unfaltering affinity for the open fields, and so he was sure he left the dog out before locking all the doors for the night. 
    
    Billy stopped himself from overthinking Banter’s mysterious appearance. He simply shooed the dog away and made a mental note that he would check the locks on the doors and windows, and dismissed this strange occurrence for the time being.   
    
    The next night, Billy’s sleep was once again disturbed, this time by a heinous growl that seemed to echo throughout the room, guttural and thick with malice. With a decisive motion, he quickly reached for his nightstand and flicked on the lamp, expecting to see Banter in his room again, although still unsure how he made his way inside. Billy felt the hair on his arms stand up and a chill flowed through his body as he observed the empty room. 
    
    On the third night, Billy woke up seemingly without reason, his senses tingling with an inexplicable dread. His eyes snapped open to behold a pair of horrid red eyes glaring from the shadowy corner in his room, freezing him in terror. Before he could react, the demonic presence charged at him, a suffocating pressure enveloping his throat, sucking the life out of him. Billy felt himself slowly losing consciousness as the world faded into darkness. 
    
    The following morning, Billy awoke to find himself laying on the cold ground in the fields, the edge of the woods looming ominously over him. He scrambled to his feet, the events of the night before running through his mind. He turned away from the house and with a sense of certitude, fled from the property as swiftly as he could, the memory of the demonic red eyes haunting him. Though torn about leaving Banter behind, he couldn’t shake the unsettling feeling that the dog was somehow at the root of the terrifying occurrences.

    title: "Apparitions",
    body: `Jack kissed his daughter’s forehead goodnight as he gently tucked her into bed. Lily, oblivious to her father's inner turmoil, would never know these were the last few moments they would share together. Her innocent smile pierced through his crumbling resolve, reminding him of the irreparable harm he was about to commit.
    
    “Sleep tight, princess,” 
  
  Lilly snuggled under the covers. 
  
  “Love you, Daddy,”
  
  Jack’s heart swelled with guilt as he turned the lights off leaving the room in a soft and peaceful glow. He closed her bedroom door and locked it behind him, slowly making his way to the garage where he produced a glass jar of odorless kerosene. He poured the volatile liquid all throughout the walls and floors of the house, the cold grip of necessity driving him to carry out his abominable plan. 
  
  Jack’s mind raced with memories of happier times, intermittently overshadowed by the crushing weight of his circumstances presently. The failure of his latest business venture, namely the closing of his beloved high-end American bistro restaurant, had plunged him into an insurmountable debt. With the threat of foreclosure looming over his home, Jack’s desperation had reached its zenith. The tragic loss of his wife, who had drowned in their family pool one fateful summer night, had already been too much to bear. It was only the life insurance payout from her untimely death that provided any sense of reprieve however briefly. But soon the bills would begin to pile up and the walls closed in, and Jack would find himself cornered by his own despair. He’d resolve to save his family from ruin, no matter the cost.  
  
  ******
  
  Fifteen years had passed since that night when Jack wantonly forged the fire that claimed his daughters life and his home. With the insurance payout from Lily’s death and the loss of the house, Jack was able to settle his debts and make a new life for himself, albeit one of solitude and regret. It was on one seemingly uneventful evening that Jack received a phone call that would shatter any sense of normalcy he had built. To his horror, the voice on the other end of the line belonged to his daughter Lily. 
  
  “I love you, Daddy,” the voice whispered in a low and sinister tone. 
Jack struggled to make sense of this impossible phone call. As he remained in a state of stupor, he caught sight of something even more incomprehensible. It was the ethereal presence of his long dead wife, an apparition returning to remind him of his past sins.
